# ironnest optimizer — design & the separation search (Phase 2b)

**Status:** Phase 2a (constructive + compaction nester) ✅ shipped (`ed8ba72`). **Phase 2b (the
overlap-minimization separation search) ✅ shipped** — sparrow's GLS ported deterministically into
`crates/optimizer/src/sep/`. This document is the design spec; §10 records what actually landed and
how it deviates from the plan below. Read [`00-…`](00-ironnest-architecture-and-plan.md) (the plan)
and [`01-…`](01-jagua-source-verification.md) (the fork grounding) first.

---

## 1. Where we are — the optimizer today (`crates/optimizer`)

Public API (`lib.rs`):

```rust
pub fn nest(
    items: &[Vec<[Scalar; 2]>],  // one outline per item type, item-local coords
    qty: &[usize],               // demand per type
    container: &[[Scalar; 2]],   // container boundary outline
    min_sep: Scalar,             // min separation (0.0 disables; drives the geo-buffer offset)
    rotations_deg: &[Scalar],    // allowed discrete rotations, degrees (default {0,90,180,270})
    seed: u64,                   // explicit PRNG seed — no entropy fallback, ever
    budget: u64,                 // samples per item placement (fixed; NEVER a wall clock)
) -> NestSolution;               // { placements: Vec<Placement>, unplaced: Vec<usize> }

pub struct Placement { pub item: usize, pub x: Scalar, pub y: Scalar, pub rotation_deg: Scalar }
```

Placements are **anchor-free**: `placed_point = Rot(rotation_deg)·original_point + (x, y)`. The
centroid-centering jagua applies at import is folded out by `search::original_to_placed`.

**Algorithm (current):**
1. **Order** items largest-first (descending CD-shape diameter; stable on ties) — `lib.rs`.
2. **Constructive fill** — for each item, `search()` (`search.rs`): two-phase sampling (80 % uniform
   over a tightening bbox + 20 % local refine), surrogate fail-fast (`detect_surrogate_collision`),
   full check (`detect_poly_collision`), kept by the **LBF loss** `10·x_max + y_max` (`loss.rs`).
   Then **drop-on-place** — `improve::place_dropped` binary-search-slides the part to bottom-left
   contact (true BLF) before committing.
3. **Improve** — `IMPROVE_ROUNDS = 3` rounds of: slide-compact every placed part toward
   bottom-left, then fill freed space with unplaced parts (`improve.rs`).
4. **Extract** anchor-free placements.

**Determinism mechanisms (all in place):** self-contained **PCG64** PRNG (`prng.rs`, no `rand`
dep — version-independent byte-stable stream); fixed sample/round budgets (no wall clock); fixed
draw order (rotation→x→y); slide is pure geometry (no PRNG); trig only via `libm`; `slotmap`/BTree,
no `HashMap`; no threads. The **in-process determinism golden** (`tests/nest.rs
::determinism_same_seed_is_byte_identical`) passes.

**Density baseline** (`examples/density.rs`, release): 10×10 in 100.5 (slack) **99 %**, 7×7 **96 %**,
13×7 bricks **87 %**, irregular pentagon **~65 %**. (The 81 % "10×10 in exactly 100" case is an
**exact-fit artifact** — touching counts as collision, so 9 fit per row not 10; not a real ceiling.)

Key files: `lib.rs` (API + orchestration), `search.rs` (per-item search + `feasible_at` +
`original_to_placed`), `loss.rs` (`LbfLoss`), `improve.rs` (`place_dropped`, `slide_bottom_left`),
`prng.rs` (PCG64), `tests/nest.rs`, `examples/density.rs`.

---

## 2. The problem Phase 2b solves

Greedy construction (even with drop-to-contact) places each part where it locally minimizes the
bottom-left loss. It **cannot discover** arrangements where parts must *interlock*: two right
triangles that pair into a square, a part that nests into another's concavity, etc. Empirically
(this session): finer rotations (4→8→12) and 4× budget did **not** help — pentagon stuck 65–69 %,
triangles 75 % when two should pair into ~100 %. This is structural, not a sampling-resolution issue.

The fix is **overlap-minimization separation** (Umetani 2009 → sparrow 2025): allow parts to
overlap, then iteratively shove them apart, using a **Guided Local Search** to escape local minima.
That is the only mechanism that rearranges already-placed parts to make room.

---

## 3. Why the first attempt failed (so we don't repeat it)

A pole-gradient separator was prototyped this session and **reverted** (not committed). It never
converged — `resolved=false` on every insertion. Root causes, each fixed by §4:

| What the attempt did | Why it failed | What sparrow does instead (§4) |
|---|---|---|
| **Hard cutoff** `ov = r₁+r₂−d` if `ov>0` | No gradient once circles barely separate → motion dies right before resolving | **Hyperbolic decay** keeps the proxy smooth & differentiable *everywhere* |
| **Analytic gradient** move (sum of repulsion vectors) | Wedged parts have canceling gradients → stuck; clamped parts block | **Sample + adaptive coordinate descent** — try candidate poses, keep the best |
| **No penalty weights** | Plain overlap-min sits in local minima forever | **GLS weights** accumulate on persistent overlaps → forces the jump out |
| **Drove the *proxy* to zero, then checked the CDE** | Inscribed poles under-cover → proxy=0 while shapes still overlap → CDE rejects → revert | **CDE is the feasibility arbiter**; the proxy only *ranks* candidates. Sample eval calls `collect_poly_collisions` (exact "who collides") and scores those by proxy |
| Single insertion, give up on first fail | No diversification | **Strikes + restart-with-two-item-swap**, keeping GLS weights |

**The key conceptual error:** the pole proxy is *not* meant to certify feasibility — the CDE does
that. The proxy is a *smooth ranking signal* for "which candidate pose overlaps least," and the
search's accept test is the exact `Layout::is_feasible` / `detect_poly_collision`. sparrow uses the
*same* inscribed poles we did — it works because of the decay + GLS + sample-based moves, not a
better overlap measure.

---

## 4. The algorithm to build — sparrow's GLS, ported deterministically

Source of truth: **sparrow** (Jeroen Gardeyn, MIT) — repo `https://github.com/JeroenGar/sparrow`,
paper *"An open-source heuristic to reboot 2D nesting research"* (arXiv **2509.13329**). Built on
jagua-rs, the same CDE we forked. Ancestor: **Umetani et al. 2009** (GLS for overlap minimization,
*Intl. Trans. OR* 16:661–683). jagua-rs CDE paper: DOI **10.1287/ijoc.2024.1025**.

> **Adapt, don't copy:** sparrow does **strip packing** (shrink a strip's width, separate, repeat).
> ironnest packs a **fixed irregular container**. We take sparrow's **separation core** (§4.1–4.4)
> but replace its strip-shrink outer loop with a **bin-packing driver** (§4.5).

### 4.1 The overlap proxy (`sparrow/src/quantify/overlap_proxy.rs`)

Each part carries **surrogate poles** = inscribed circles (poles of inaccessibility; jagua already
generates these — `SPSurrogate::poles: Vec<Circle>`, ~8–16 per part, transformed rigidly with the
part). For a pole pair `(p, q)` across two parts, circle–circle penetration with **hyperbolic
decay**:

```
pd        = (p.radius + q.radius) - dist(p.center, q.center)
epsilon   = max(diam_a, diam_b) * 0.01          // OVERLAP_PROXY_EPSILON_DIAM_RATIO
pd_decay  = if pd >= epsilon { pd } else { epsilon^2 / (-pd + 2*epsilon) }   // smooth, >0 always
overlap  += pd_decay * min(p.radius, q.radius)
// after all pairs:  overlap *= PI
```

Final pair loss with a **shape-difficulty penalty** (geometric mean of √convex-hull-area, so
big/concave parts cost more): `loss = sqrt(overlap_proxy + epsilon^2) * sqrt(sqrt(hullA)*sqrt(hullB))`.
Container collisions: same with a `2.0` factor and `penalty = shape_penalty(s, s)`.

Only `+ − × ÷ sqrt` — all IEEE-deterministic. Port `f32 → Scalar` (f64). The convex-hull area is on
the surrogate (`SPSurrogate::convex_hull_area`, geo `fail_fast/sp_surrogate.rs`).

### 4.2 Guided Local Search weights (`sparrow/src/quantify/tracker.rs`)

Objective = **total weighted overlap**: `Σ weight·loss` over all colliding pairs **and** container
collisions, stored in a symmetric `PairMatrix` (item×item) of `{ loss, weight }` (weight ≥ 1.0).
After each separation iteration, every entry's weight is multiplied by `m`, then `max(1.0)`:

- colliding pair: `m = 1.2 + (2.0 − 1.2) · (loss / max_loss_this_iter)` — worst collision grows fastest
- separated pair: `m = 0.95` (decay toward 1)

Constants (`consts.rs`): `GLS_WEIGHT_MIN_INC_RATIO=1.2`, `GLS_WEIGHT_MAX_INC_RATIO=2.0`,
`GLS_WEIGHT_DECAY=0.95`. Persistently-overlapping pairs accumulate weight until a part faces
prohibitive weight with all neighbours and **jumps elsewhere** — the GLS escape (no annealing).

### 4.3 Moving a part — sample + coordinate descent (`sparrow/src/sample/`, `eval/sep_evaluator.rs`)

**No analytic gradient, no MTV.** For each colliding part (processed in a PRNG-shuffled order),
`move_item` = remove → evaluate candidate poses → place at the best:

1. **Sampling** (`uniform_sampler.rs`): ~**1000** uniform poses across the container (+ optional
   focused-near-current). Default `N_UNIFORM_SAMPLES=1000`, `N_COORD_DESCENTS=3` (`consts.rs`).
2. **Refinement** (`coord_descent.rs`): **adaptive coordinate descent**, not gradient — cycle axes
   {Horizontal, Vertical, ForwardDiag, BackwardDiag, (Wiggle=rotation)}; propose two candidates
   either side of current along the active axis; step ×`1.1` on improvement, ×`0.5` on failure;
   stop when all steps fall below limits. (Drop **Wiggle** for discrete rotations → no continuous
   trig — a determinism win.)
3. **Sample evaluation** (`sep_evaluator.rs`): for a candidate `dt`, ask the **CDE** which entities
   it collides with (`collect_poly_collisions`), then score `Σ weight·overlap_proxy` over those.
   Supports an **`upper_bound` early bailout** (`collector.early_terminate`) — abandon a candidate
   once it exceeds the best-so-far; this is what makes 1000 samples affordable.

### 4.4 The separator loop (`sparrow/src/optimizer/separator.rs`)

```
while n_strikes < strike_limit:                       // kmax (explore ~3, compress ~5)
  while n_iter_no_improvement < iter_no_improve_limit: // nmax (explore ~200, compress ~100)
    move_items(...)                                   // §4.3 over all colliding parts
    update_weights(...)                               // §4.2
    loss = total UNWEIGHTED overlap
    if loss < min_loss * 0.98 { min_loss = loss; n_iter_no_improvement = 0 } else { ++ }
  if improved vs strike start { reset strikes } else { ++n_strikes }
  restore_but_keep_weights(incumbent); swap two large items   // perturbation, keeps GLS weights
return feasible?(loss == 0)
```

### 4.5 Bin-packing driver (our adaptation — replaces sparrow's strip shrink)

sparrow creates overlap by shrinking the strip. We have a fixed container, so create overlap by
**insertion**. After the current `improve()` pass, for each still-unplaced part (largest-first):

```
snapshot = layout.save()
place the part at its lowest-overlap pose (sample by proxy, §4.3 step 1)
run the separator (§4.4) on the whole layout    // may move neighbours
if layout.is_feasible(): keep (part placed)      // CDE is the arbiter
else: layout.restore(snapshot)                   // couldn't make room
```

Optional richer driver (closer to sparrow, higher density): place **all** parts up front (overlaps
allowed), then separate the whole layout; if it can't reach zero overlap, remove the
highest-weighted part and retry. Start with the simpler insertion driver; graduate if needed.

---

## 5. Determinism adaptations (mandatory — sparrow is NOT byte-deterministic as shipped)

| sparrow (as shipped) | ironnest requirement |
|---|---|
| `f32` proxy/tracker | `Scalar` = **f64** throughout (proxy uses only `+−×÷sqrt`, safe) |
| `N_WORKERS = 3` threads (`worker.rs`) | **single canonical worker** (no rayon/threads on placement path) |
| **wall-clock** time limit (`-t`, 80/20 split) | **fixed iteration/sample budget** — never a clock |
| `rand` ecosystem RNG | our vendored **PCG64** (`prng.rs`); seed explicitly; fix every order (sample draw, shuffle, swap) to the PRNG stream |
| `Wiggle` continuous rotation (trig) | discrete rotations {0,90,180,270} → **drop Wiggle**, no `sin_cos` (or route through `libm` if continuous is ever added) |
| `target-cpu=native` + nightly `simd/` | scalar path only; CLAUDE.md already bans `-C target-cpu=native` |
| `min_by_key(OrderedFloat(..))` ties | **deterministic tie-break** (by item id / sample index) — equal proxy losses are plausible |
| float summation in the collector | **fix the accumulation order** — float `+` is non-associative; sum pairs in a stable (id) order |

Everything must keep the existing rules (CLAUDE.md "determinism rules"): `BTree`/`slotmap` only, no
`HashMap`, no FMA, libm-only trig, no wall clock. The in-process golden + (eventually) the
cross-platform golden (Phase 3) are the proof.

---

## 6. The geometry/CDE API to build on (verified file:line)

**Collision (the feasibility arbiter):**
- `CDEngine::detect_poly_collision(shape, filter) -> bool` — `cde/.../cd_engine.rs:166`
- `CDEngine::detect_surrogate_collision(surrogate, transf, filter) -> bool` — `:210` (fast fail)
- `CDEngine::collect_poly_collisions(shape, &mut collector)` — `:268` (which hazards collide → the
  set sparrow scores). `BasicHazardCollector` (`hazards/collector.rs`); `NoFilter` /
  `HazKeyFilter::from_keys` (`hazards/filter.rs`).

**Surrogate poles (the proxy input):** `shape.surrogate() -> &SPSurrogate`
(`geo/.../simple_polygon.rs:115`); `SPSurrogate { poles: Vec<Circle>, convex_hull_area: Scalar, … }`
(`geo/.../fail_fast/sp_surrogate.rs:22`); `Circle { center: Point, radius: Scalar }`, implements
`Transformable`. A **placed** item already carries transformed poles:
`layout.placed_items[pk].shape.surrogate().poles`. Pole circle–circle penetration is the proxy.

**Distance/separation primitives that DO exist** (note: only against `Point`, not poly–poly):
`SeparationDistance<Point> for SPolygon` returns `(Interior, distance_to_closest_edge)` if inside —
i.e. a **per-point penetration depth** (`geo/.../simple_polygon.rs:344`). `Edge::collides_at(&Edge)
-> Option<Point>` exact intersection (`edge.rs:63`), `Edge::closest_point_on_edge`
(`edge.rs:75`), `edge_intersection` (`edge.rs:199`). There is **no** SPolygon–SPolygon distance and
**no** Minkowski/NFP in the fork.

**Layout mutation (integration):** `Layout::save()->LayoutSnapshot` / `restore` (`layout.rs:58/69`),
`place_item(&Item, DTransformation)->PItemKey` / `remove_item(PItemKey)` (`:81/:96`), `cde()`
(`:133`), `is_feasible()` (`:139`), public `placed_items: SlotMap<PItemKey, PlacedItem>`.
`PlacedItem { item_id, d_transf, shape: Arc<SPolygon> }`.

**Integration point:** in `lib.rs::nest`, the separator runs **after** the `improve::improve(...)`
call and **before** `extract_placements(...)`, mutating `layout` and `placed_per_type`.

---

## 7. Two design paths (recommended order)

1. **PRIMARY — proxy-driven GLS (sparrow's core).** §4 verbatim, de-threaded / f64 / PCG64 /
   fixed-budget. Pros: proven SoTA; only `+−×÷sqrt`; reuses jagua's poles + CDE; lowest determinism
   risk. The pole proxy never needs to be exact (CDE is the arbiter). **Build this.**
2. **OPTIONAL refinement — exact NFP directional penetration**, *only* on discrete rotations
   (precompute No-Fit-Polygons per shape-pair × rotation; penetration = distance to nearest NFP
   edge — Umetani's exact measure). Most accurate, but NFP construction is the classic
   numerical-robustness minefield and a determinism liability to prove. Consider only if the proxy
   GLS leaves density on the table after tuning.
   - **Avoid GJK+EPA** as the primary measure (convex-only → concave decomposition distorts the very
     concave-pocket interlocking we want; iterative tolerance is an extra determinism risk).
   - **Avoid raster/penetration-map** (grid-quantizes placements — incompatible with byte-exact
     continuous `(x,y)`).

The CDE-survey agent independently proposed an **edge-based poly-penetration / MTV** built from
`collect_poly_collisions` + `Edge::collides_at` + per-vertex `sq_separation_distance`. That's a valid
exact-penetration path (a lighter cousin of NFP), but it is *not* what the SoTA does and adds
robustness/determinism surface. **Treat it as a fallback, not the first build** — the proxy GLS is
the recommended path.

---

## 8. Concrete build plan (incremental, each step verifiable)

1. **`quantify` module** — port the overlap proxy (§4.1) to f64 + the `PairMatrix`/tracker (§4.2).
   Unit-test: proxy of two identical squares at increasing offsets is monotone & smooth; weight
   update matches the formula.
2. **Sample-eval** — `collect_poly_collisions` + proxy scoring + the `upper_bound` early bailout,
   with a **fixed summation order** (sort colliding keys). Unit-test determinism (same layout+pose →
   same score).
3. **`move_item`** — sampler (PCG64, 1000 uniform) + adaptive coordinate descent (§4.3, no Wiggle).
   Single worker. Determinism test.
4. **Separator loop** (§4.4) — strikes, no-improvement counter, restore-keeping-weights, two-item
   swap. All counts fixed (no clock).
5. **Bin-packing driver** (§4.5) — the insertion form first. Wire after `improve()`.
6. **Measure** on `examples/density.rs` (pentagon, plus add a right-triangle case that *should* pair
   to ~100 %). Target: irregular density 65 % → 80–85 %.
7. **Tune** constants (sample count, nmax/kmax, decay) — but keep them **fixed integers/ratios**,
   never time. Re-run the in-process determinism golden after every change.
8. **Verify** — determinism-auditor + rust-reviewer workflow (as in Phases 1–2); then the Phase-3
   cross-platform golden is the final proof.

**Budget/perf note:** the separator is the expensive part (1000 samples × parts × iterations ×
strikes). Keep test sizes tiny (debug is slow — the existing dense test was 131 s before shrinking).
Profile in `--release`; gate large runs behind the `density` example, not unit tests.

---

## 9. Open questions / verify-before-coding (research caveats)

Read these in the actual sparrow source before hardcoding (the briefing was from GitHub raw fetch,
not a compile):
- **Exact constants** — `nmax/kmax/iter_no_improve/strike_limit` and the sample counts: confirm in
  `sparrow/src/config.rs` + `consts.rs` (paper Table 1 gives ~200/3 explore, ~100/5 compress).
- **`max_loss`** in the weight update — per-iteration vs global? Check `tracker.rs::update_weights`.
- **Collector summation order** — confirm `sep_evaluator.rs` / the specialized collector sums in a
  fixed order (float `+` is non-associative → our determinism depends on it).
- **Surrogate-pole generation determinism** — poles come from jagua's `SPSurrogate` (polylabel:
  priority-queue cell subdivision). Confirm our fork's generation is ordered (BTree/sorted, not
  HashMap) so the pole set is byte-identical cross-platform. (`geo/.../fail_fast/pole.rs`.)
- **Umetani 2009** weight rule (paywalled) — free preprint exists if the exact increment is needed;
  sparrow's rule (§4.2) is the practical one to implement.

---

## 10. What shipped (Phase 2b as built)

The PRIMARY path (§7.1, proxy-driven GLS) landed in `crates/optimizer/src/sep/`. Layered leaf→root:
`proxy.rs` (§4.1) → `tracker.rs` (§4.2, `PairMatrix` + GLS weights) → `evaluator.rs` (§4.3 sample
eval) → `search.rs` (§4.3 sampler + best-samples + coordinate descent) → `separator.rs` (§4.4 strike
loop) → `mod.rs` (§4.5 **insertion driver**). Wired into `lib.rs::nest` after `improve()`, gated
naturally (a no-op when nothing is unplaced, so dense rectangular cases pay nothing). 35 tests pass;
`cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` clean.

**Results** (`examples/density.rs`, release): 13×7 bricks **87 → 92 %**, pentagon **65 → 79 %**, and a
new interlock probe — two right-triangles that must pair into a square — places **2/2 (82.6 %)**,
proving the separator discovers arrangements greedy construction cannot. (Rectangular 7×7 / 10×10
stay at 96 / 99 %.) Budgets are sparrow's separator defaults, scaled up modestly (`SEP_CONFIG`:
80+40 samples, 150 no-improve iters, 4 strikes; 400 seed samples) — all fixed integers. An in-process
determinism test on the separation path
(`separation_search_is_deterministic_and_finds_interlock`) and per-function unit tests on the
determinism-critical primitives (`calc_idx`, `update_weights`, `BestSamples`, `SampleEval`,
`Prng::shuffle`) lock the port.

**Deviations from the plan above (and why):**
- **Move = remove-item-first**, then search the reduced layout, then place — instead of sparrow's
  keep-in-place + self-exclude (§4.3). Same effect, simpler; the tracker still holds the moved item's
  weight row (keyed by its pre-move `PItemKey`) for the evaluator to read during the search.
- **No `upper_bound` early-bailout** (§4.3 step 3). The evaluator uses `collect_poly_collisions` +
  a **canonical sorted-`HazKey` summation** instead — robustness (byte-identical regardless of CDE
  traversal order) over the constant-factor speedup. The specialized early-terminate pipeline remains
  a future perf option (it carries a cross-platform ULP-edge risk near the bound).
- **No two-item swap inside the separator.** Faithful to sparrow's `separator.rs::separate`, which
  only rolls back to the incumbent and keeps GLS weights between strikes; the swap lives in sparrow's
  *explore* loop, which our fixed-container insertion driver replaces. The GLS weights are the
  diversifier. (A swap-on-retry is a future density lever — §4.5 "richer driver".)
- **Unplaceable-pose guard:** the coordinate descent moves freely in x/y, so it can wander a part
  outside the quadtree root bbox; `evaluate_sample` returns `SampleEval::Invalid` (worst rank) for
  any pose whose bbox is not `Surrounding`-related to `cde().bbox()`, so the search never *returns*
  one. (Without this, `place_item` registers a hazard outside all quadrants → debug-assert panic /
  release CDE-invariant corruption. Found by the post-merge adversarial review.) For irregular
  containers the inflated-square quadtree leaves a margin, so in-bbox-outside-container poses are
  still scored as `Exterior` collisions and remain usable; only truly unplaceable poses are rejected.

**Determinism adaptations actually used** (per §5): `Scalar`=f64 throughout; single worker (no
rayon); fixed `strike_limit × iter_no_imprv_limit` + fixed sample/coord-descent counts (no clock);
vendored PCG64 for every draw + a Fisher–Yates `Prng::shuffle` for the colliding-item order; **no
Wiggle** (discrete rotations, no continuous trig); `SampleEval` ordering via exact `Scalar::total_cmp`
(deterministic total order, replaces sparrow's `FPA`-fuzzy compare — changes tie-breaks vs sparrow);
canonical summation everywhere a float reduction feeds a decision (tracker dense-index sums; evaluator
sorted-`HazKey` sums). `BTreeSet`/`SecondaryMap`/`slotmap` only.

**Density status:** the candidate "next levers" (bigger budget, the place-all-then-separate richer
driver, a true-outline container proxy, finer rotations) were **measured and none helped** — the
irregular density is at a *structural* ceiling, not a tuning one. See **§11**. The cross-platform
golden (Phase 3) is the determinism proof.

---

## 11. Density tuning — what was tried and why it didn't help (negative results, 2026-06-21)

After Phase 2b the realistic density sits at **rectangular 92–99 %**, **pentagon 79.1 % (23/40)**,
**irregular L-sheet 74.7 %**. Four tuning levers were each implemented (or configured), **measured on
`examples/density.rs`, and reverted** — record them so they are not re-tried:

| Lever (what was tried) | Result | Why it failed |
|---|---|---|
| **Bigger fixed budget** — `SEP_CONFIG` ~doubled (150/75 samples, 300 iters, 6 strikes, 800 seed) | pentagon **79.1 % → 79.1 %** (no change); bricks +0.9 pp | The pentagon is **not budget-limited** — more search effort finds the *same* arrangement. |
| **Place-all-then-separate richer driver** (§4.5) — seed all unplaced to a 100 %-area over-fill, separate the whole layout, remove the highest-weighted (most-stuck) part until feasible | pentagon **79.1 % → 75.7 % (regression)** and **~20× slower** (≈114 s vs ≈5 s) | A 100 %-area over-fill is far too aggressive for non-tiling parts (sparrow over-fills ~1 % per strip-shrink step; this over-fills ~18 %). The separator lands in a *worse* minimum and the remove-loop is expensive. A gentler over-fill is just the insertion driver again. |
| **True-outline container proxy** — replace the bbox exterior quantifier with pole-penetration against the *actual* container outline (correct for concave boundaries) | L-sheet **74.7 % → 74.7 %** (no change) | The bottleneck for an irregular sheet is **construction** (which already respects the true outline via the CDE), *not* the separation proxy. Separation only runs for the unplaced tail, where the proxy change didn't place more. |
| **Finer rotations** — 45° (8), 30° (12), **10° (36)** vs cardinal | pentagon **23/40 at every increment**; 7×7 square 96 % at every increment | Squares are rotation-invariant; for the pentagon the ceiling is the **search strategy**, not the orientation set. Finer rotations only add cost (and forfeit the future exact-cardinal-matrix nicety) for zero gain. |

**The pentagon plateaus at exactly 23 placed across all four levers** → a robust local optimum. The
one untried lever (sparrow's **two-item swap** diversifier, §4.4) is rated low-probability: 2× budget,
global rearrangement, and 36 rotations all failed to escape the plateau, so a milder diversification
is unlikely to.

**Conclusion — the remaining gap is architectural, not a tuning knob.** Closing it would require a
fundamentally different placement engine:
- **Exact NFP (no-fit-polygon) placement** — the SoTA for irregular-nesting density, but a
  numerical-robustness + determinism minefield (§7.2 explicitly says *avoid as a first build*).
- **Continuous-rotation GA** — inherently non-deterministic; conflicts with the prime directive unless
  very carefully seeded, and even then loses cut-realizability exactness.

Both are major builds with real determinism risk — **not optimizations**. Given the engine is already
dense *and* byte-deterministic across the fleet (the actual differentiator), banking the current
result is the recommended posture; revisit NFP only if a consumer benchmark proves the density gap
costs real material.

### 11.1 Round 2 (2026-06-23): profiling, the breadth lever that *worked*, and two more dead ends

A second pass revisited the "architectural ceiling" conclusion above. Two findings refine it.

**Profile first.** Per-phase timing (`examples/bench.rs`) shows the **separation search is 97–99 % of
wall-clock** on any nest with an unplaced tail (pentagon: 3330 ms of 3340 ms; bricks: 2390/2440 ms);
construction + improve are single-digit ms. The cost is irreducible per-sample collision-query +
pole-pair proxy compute across a well-tuned budget. Consequence: the candidate "quick perf wins"
(collector reuse, hazkey cache, incremental loss) are each ~0 — they touch <0.1 % of runtime. Collector
reuse was kept as byte-identical hygiene; the others were dropped as measured non-levers.

**The breadth lever §11 missed: multi-start.** §11 round-1 only ever tested *depth* (one seed/ordering,
more budget → same basin). It never tested *breadth* — K **decorrelated seeds**, keep the densest. That
is fully byte-deterministic (each start is the golden-stable pipeline; the keep-best reduction is an
integer/`total_cmp` argmax over placed area, earliest-k on tie — no float sum on the decision path) and
it **works on heterogeneous parts**: 13×7 bricks **91.9 % → 95.5 %** at K=8 (`examples/seedsweep.rs`,
distribution `{101:1, 102:4, 104:4, 105:7}` over 16 seeds). Shipped as `nest_multistart` /
`nest_multistart_per_item` (additive API; `n_starts=1` is byte-identical to `nest`) + a `parallel`
cargo feature that runs the K starts on `std::thread::scope` threads (3.6× faster, byte-identical — the
golden re-runs under `--features parallel` cross-platform). The pentagon shows **zero** seed spread
(`{22:12, 23:4}`, best = 23) — its cap is genuinely architectural; multi-start cannot move it.

**Two more dead ends** (measured on `examples/bench.rs`, reverted):

| Lever (what was tried) | Result | Why it failed |
|---|---|---|
| **Structured anchor seeding (B3)** — a deterministic G×G LBF grid per rotation, competing additively with the random search | pentagon **23**, bricks **101**, 7×7 **196** — **no change anywhere** | `place_dropped`'s bottom-left slide already snaps loose random samples to the same contacts; structured coverage reaches nothing the slide didn't. |
| **ILS ruin-and-recreate (C2)** — evict K placed parts, re-insert via the separator, keep if ≥ (the diversifier §11 called "untried") | pentagon **23 (cap holds)**, bricks **101 → 102 (+1)**, **~4.5× slower** | The one untested diversifier, finally tested: it does **not** break the pentagon cap, and its +1 brick is **strictly dominated** by multi-start's +4 (which also parallelises). Confirms §11's architectural-ceiling diagnosis is robust. |

**Revised conclusion.** The *pentagon-class* gap is still architectural (NFP / continuous rotation —
unchanged). But the **heterogeneous-parts** gap §11 attributed to that ceiling was partly a *breadth*
gap, and best-of-K multi-start closes a chunk of it deterministically. For the consumer's mixed corpus
(the real target), `restarts=N` is the lever — benchmark there to pick K. Every separation- or
construction-side micro-tweak (B3, C2, and the §11 four) is dominated by it.

### 11.2 Round 3 (2026-07-09): Deepnest gap analysis — two levers shipped, one measured dead end

A source-verified read of Deepnest/SVGnest (exact-NFP contact placement + a GA over insertion order
and rotations, NFP-cached, anytime) framed three near-term levers. All three were implemented and
measured; two shipped, one was reverted with a mechanism-level explanation.

**Shipped 1 — deterministic early-terminate in the sample evaluator** (sparrow's `upper_bound`
bailout, §4.3, previously forgone). Now that the evaluator sums in canonical sorted-`HazKey` order,
a **strict-greater** bailout on the running partial sum is *provably decision-identical* to the full
sum: terms are strictly positive, so a truncated value (returned only when partial > bound) and the
full value land on the same side of every downstream compare, and any value that is *kept* is an
exact full sum. Bounds plumbed: `BestSamples::upper_bound()` into the sampling loops, the descent's
current eval into the coordinate descent, best-so-far into `lowest_overlap_pose` (plus an
`OverlapScratch` to stop per-sample allocations). **Result:** placements byte-identical (goldens
untouched — the proof the invariant holds), separation-heavy probes ~12–14 % faster (bricks
2423→2094 ms, pentagon 3374→2964 ms, bricks K=8 22.5→19.4 s). The remaining hot cost is
`collect_poly_collisions` itself, which a bound cannot skip without forking deeper into the CDE.

**Shipped 2 — multi-start order diversification** (`start_order_policy`, `ORDER_JITTER = 0.3`).
Round 2's multi-start varies only the sampling noise; every start still inserts in the same
largest-first order — the one dimension Deepnest's GA searches that we didn't. Now the **trailing
`⌊K/2⌋` starts** re-sort with seeded multiplicative noise on the diameter keys (drawn ascending-id
from the start's own PRNG, before any placement draw); the leading `⌈K/2⌉` — including `k = 0`, so
`n_starts == 1 ≡ nest()` — stay canonical. Two split designs were measured:
- **Splitting at all matters**: jittering *all* `k > 0` regressed (order noise replaced the proven
  sampling-noise breadth; mixed 4-type K=8 94.2 → 93.2 %).
- **Contiguous blocks beat k-parity interleaving.** Parity ("odd k jitter") aliases the canonical
  half with every-other absolute seed stream, so for a fixed base seed half the canonical streams
  are unreachable at *any* K — measured on the consumer corpus (below) as a floor drop no K could
  repair. The block split keeps the canonical streams contiguous from `seed`, so
  `nest_multistart(seed, 2K)` provably contains every canonical stream of `nest_multistart(seed, K)`
  — **the old best-of-K is a floor for the new best-of-2K**.

On 5 base seeds at K=8 (`examples/orderdiv.rs`, block policy): similar-diameter corpus 94.22 →
93.83 % (−0.4 pp); **diameter-misleading strips corpus 94.15 → 95.45 % mean, best seeds 94.8 →
95.9 %** — order jitter pays exactly where largest-diameter-first is a trap (long skinny parts
out-diameter compact high-area parts), at little cost elsewhere. The per-start wiring lives in one
place (`multistart_start`, a doc(hidden) test hook), so the sequential and `parallel` builds cannot
drift. Cross-platform byte-stability of the jittered path is pinned by the new
**`multistart-overflow` golden case** (overflow demand; the best-of-3 winner is the k=2 *jittered*
start, per-start areas [646, 646, 673]) — the pre-existing `multistart-mixed` case all-places and
ties, so it can only ever exercise k=0.

**Consumer-corpus measurement** (`drawing_and_gcode` `tools/nest_benchmark.py --mixed` semantics:
13-type realistic cut list, 120×60 sheet, 1.3× over-subscribed, `part_gap 0.375` / `edge_margin
0.5`, cardinal rotations, budget 500, base seeds 1–4 — the #258 acceptance harness; Python BLF
baseline 75.5 %, rectpack floor 67.3 %):

| config | per-seed utilization (seeds 1–4) | mean | wall-clock/nest |
|---|---|---|---|
| v0.4.1, `restarts=8` (current pin) | 82.76 / 82.76 / 82.76 / 82.76 | 82.76 % | 214–236 s |
| this round, `restarts=8` | 81.58 / 81.58 / 82.47 / 83.66 | 82.32 % | 177–204 s |
| this round, **`restarts=16`** | 83.66 / 83.66 / 83.66 / 82.76 | **83.44 %** | 311–345 s |

v0.4.1's all-canonical best-of-8 **saturates at 82.76 % on every seed** — more canonical breadth
cannot move it. At the same K=8 the split halves canonical coverage, so the floor can dip (81.58 %);
at **`restarts=16`** the contiguous canonical block covers exactly v0.4.1's 8 streams, so its
82.76 % is the guaranteed floor (measured: held on all 4 seeds) and the 8 jittered starts add the
upside (83.66 % — the harness's all-time best — on 3 of 4 seeds): **+0.68 pp mean, +0.9 pp typical,
at ~1.45× the old wall-clock** (the early-terminate speedup funds part of the doubling). **Ship the
engine bump and `DEFAULT_RESTARTS = 16` together** — the new engine at the old K=8 pin is a small
mean regression, the pair is a strict improvement.

**Reverted — the compression phase** (sparrow's compress loop, the §4.5 adaptation this doc
recommended trying gently after §11's 18 %-at-once failure). Implemented as a stepping virtual-wall
keep-out (2 % of occupied width per step, walled twin container per step, separate, adopt-on-
feasible, then refill via the insertion driver; fixed rounds/steps). **Zero density change on every
probe** — rectangles, bricks, pentagon, the mixed 105 % corpus, and an L-shaped-container probe
(internal-fragmentation case), across seeds — at 2–3.5× the runtime (bricks 2.1→7.0 s, mixed K=1
3.6→12.7 s). *Mechanism, not tuning:* in a **fixed bin**, `sep::try_insert` already seeds each
unplaced part at its lowest-overlap pose and lets the GLS move **every** neighbour under strike
pressure — a part-sized, perfectly-targeted squeeze. An untargeted global wall squeeze is a strictly
weaker version of the mechanism that already ran, and its freed edge slice at 92–96 % util is always
sub-part-sized (our objective is discrete part admission, not sparrow's continuous strip width — the
squeeze only pays in part-sized quanta that don't exist at these utilizations). This also explains
§11's place-all-then-separate regression from first principles. **Do not re-try wall/shrink
compression in the fixed-bin engine.**

**Standing conclusion.** With breadth (multi-start × order diversification) and the evaluator bailout
banked, the remaining Deepnest-class density gap is the §11 architectural one: **exact-NFP contact
placement** (integer-arithmetic Minkowski on discrete rotations — Deepnest's own robustness answer,
and *more* cross-platform-deterministic than floats, not less) and part-in-hole nesting. That is a
build, not a tune — spec it against the consumer's `nest_benchmark.py --mixed` before committing.
