# ironnest — Claude working notes

**ironnest is a deterministic, embeddable, true-shape 2D nesting engine for irregular parts.**
Rust core + a PyO3 wheel. It is a **fork-and-extend of [jagua-rs](https://github.com/JeroenGar/jagua-rs)**
(MPL-2.0) — its collision-detection engine pushed to **f64** and made **cross-platform
byte-reproducible** — with **our own placement optimizer** on top.

**Read first:** [`docs/00-ironnest-architecture-and-plan.md`](docs/00-ironnest-architecture-and-plan.md)
(the plan), [`docs/01-jagua-source-verification.md`](docs/01-jagua-source-verification.md) (the
source-verified fork grounding), [`docs/02-optimizer-and-separation-search.md`](docs/02-optimizer-and-separation-search.md)
(the optimizer design + measured results), and [`docs/03-nfp-construction-mode.md`](docs/03-nfp-construction-mode.md)
(the designed-but-not-built exact-NFP construction mode — feature #4). They are the source of
truth; this file is the short version.

**Status (2026-06-21):** Phase 1 (fork→f64) ✅ · Phase 2a (constructive+compaction nester, 92–99% on
rectangular parts) ✅ · Phase 2b (sparrow GLS **separation search**, `crates/optimizer/src/sep/`;
irregular density pentagon 65→79 %, bricks 87→92 %, discovers interlocks — `docs/02` §10) ✅ · Phase 3
(**determinism harness**: `golden_dump` bin + `insta` golden + `.github/workflows/ci.yml` x-platform
gate on macOS-arm64/Win-x64/linux) ✅ · Phase 4 (**PyO3 `ironnest` wheel** via `crates/ironnest` façade +
`crates/py`; abi3-py313, maturin + `wheels.yml`/`supply-chain.yml`; `import ironnest` validated) ✅ ·
Phase 6 (**interior-void holes + multi-sheet**: `nest(holes…)` keep-out zones = "nesting inside parts",
`nest_multi(sheets…)`; bound in the wheel — `docs/00` §10) ✅ · Determinism-hardening (**risk #2
resolved**: vendored libm-deterministic min-sep offsetter in `crates/geo/src/buffer/`; dropped
`geo`/`atomic-polyfill`; min_sep>0 now x-platform byte-identical) ✅ · Optimizer round 3 (2026-07-09,
`docs/02` §11.2): evaluator **early-terminate** (~13 % faster separation, byte-identical proof) +
multi-start **order diversification** (parity split; +1 pp on diameter-misleading mixes) ✅; wall
compression measured → reverted (insertion-driven separation subsumes it — don't re-try) ·
**Feature #4 (exact-NFP construction, `docs/03`): N0 GO → N1a ✅ → N1 ✅ (2026-07-10)** —
N0 `examples/nfp_spike.rs`: mixed-13 consumer corpus 79.7 % in 0.94 s construction-only (full
sampling K=1 pipeline: 80–83 % in 150–214 s); contact-columns 100/100; interlock by construction.
N1a: import hoist (`Problem`/`import_problem`), goldens byte-identical. N1: integer substrate in
`crates/optimizer/src/nfp/` (doc-hidden pub) — 2^20 grid/i64/i128, convex edge-merge fast path,
orientation-normalized convolution union-fill, **quads-only face-classified IFP** (P1 caught the
concave-pocket leak of the naive frame seed — docs/03 §11.2), □E=16 backoff, eager mirror-derived
pair cache, domain gate; `i_overlay = 7.0.2` exact-pinned (integer i64 API only). N2 ✅: placer +
`PlacementStrategy`/`NestConfig`/`NestError`/`nest_with_config` (+`nest_multi_with_config`), 6 NFP
goldens blessed. N3 ✅: block-split policy wins the NFP A/B (94.01 vs 93.49 %); `PartsGeometry`
shared across sheets; `nfp-multistart` golden (jittered winner) incl. `--features parallel`.
N4 ✅ core: wheel ships `strategy="sampling"|"nfp"` on both pyfunctions; **ACCEPTANCE = SHIP
OPT-IN** — consumer corpus K=16 paired: NFP 83.88 % vs sampling 83.27 % mean (+0.61 pp, floor held
every seed, 1.02× clock, 84.03 % all-time best). Follow-ups: consumer adapter `strategy=` +
`placement_mode` audit key (`drawing_and_gcode` #258), ESICUP tracker, rejection-counter
surfacing, post-sep NFP refill (the GO lever). See `docs/03`.

## ⛔ Two prime directives

1. **Determinism is the product.** The same inputs MUST produce **byte-identical** placements — and
   therefore a byte-identical downstream cut program — on **every platform we ship** (macOS-arm64
   dev == Windows-x64 prod). This is what the consumer (a 260 A plasma tool) needs for its machine
   audit trail, and it is ironnest's differentiator. It is proven by a **cross-platform CI golden**,
   not assumed. Anything that can break it is a bug, not a tuning knob.

2. **The engine is a pure placement oracle.** In: polygons + an irregular container (boundary +
   holes/keepout zones) + a min-separation + an allowed-rotation set + a seed + an iteration budget.
   Out: `(item, x, y, rotation)`. **It knows NOTHING about kerf, leads, pierces, cut sequencing,
   G-code, or any machine number** — those live in the consumer, which re-validates every layout and
   refuses an illegal-but-dense one. Never put plasma/machine concepts in here.

## The determinism rules (how directive #1 is enforced)

The forked jagua core is *already* mostly deterministic (slotmap + BTree, no library RNG, rayon is
import-only-then-resorted, `Instant` is metadata). Keep it that way. The verified rules:

- **`Scalar = f64`** — define `pub type Scalar = f64;` and use it everywhere; never re-introduce
  hard-coded `f32`. (f64 is for robustness; it is *not* the determinism lever.)
- **Discrete rotations `{0, 90, 180, 270}`.** Rotation trig routes through the pinned pure-Rust
  `libm` crate (byte-identical across platforms) — **never std `sin_cos`/`sin`/`cos`/`atan2`**. As
  of the Phase-1 fork this runs on the placement path (via `DTransformation::compose()` per placed
  item) and is deterministic. The **optimizer should additionally build the exact cardinal matrices
  (entries ∈ {0, ±1}) directly** on the placement path — for *exactness / cut-realizability* (zero
  trig, no sub-ULP fuzz on placed coords), an optimization independent of the determinism `libm`
  already guarantees. Continuous rotation, if ever added, must likewise route through `libm`.
- **The min-separation offset is deterministic. ✅ (was risk #2; resolved 2026-06-21.)** jagua used
  `geo-buffer::buffer_polygon_rounded`, whose arc-joins called std `sin`/`cos` (platform-divergent).
  We **vendored** that straight-skeleton offsetter into `crates/geo/src/buffer/` and routed its two
  `rotate_by` trig lines through `libm`; the two `geo` traits it used were reimplemented on
  `geo-types`, so `geo`/`rstar`/`heapless`/`atomic-polyfill` are gone. `offset_shape` now calls the
  vendored fn; a nonzero-`min_sep` case is in the x-platform golden. **Keep the offsetter's trig on
  `libm`** — never revert to std. (See `docs/00` §11 risk #2 / the Determinism-hardening roadmap entry.)
- **No RNG except our own seeded, portable PRNG.** The optimizer **vendors a self-contained PCG64**
  (`crates/optimizer/src/prng.rs`) — no `rand` dep, so the exact bit-stream is version-independent
  and byte-stable forever. Explicit seed always; no `getrandom`/`rand::random()` fallback, ever.
- **No `rayon` / threads on any placement-deciding path.** Single canonical worker; if parallel, fix
  the reduction order. (Import-time `par_iter` is fine — it's re-sorted by id.) **The one sanctioned
  exception:** `nest_multistart`'s `parallel` feature runs the K independent best-of-K starts on
  `std::thread::scope` threads — each start is the self-contained, golden-stable `multistart_start`
  (own PRNG/`Layout`, no shared state; per-start seed + insertion-order policy have a single
  definition shared with the sequential build), results join in fixed k order, and the keep-best
  `total_cmp` argmax runs after all joins, so no float reduction crosses a thread. Never thread *inside* a single
  placement search. Proven by the golden re-run under `--features parallel` (CI, all 3 platforms).
- **`BTreeMap`/`BTreeSet`/`slotmap` only** where order affects placement. Never std `HashMap`
  (per-process random iteration).
- **No `f64::mul_add` / no fast-math.** Basic `+ - * / sqrt` and `powi` are IEEE-deterministic — safe.
- Stamp solution metadata (`time_stamp`) to a constant for reproducible output.

## The fork

- Upstream: **jagua-rs 0.7.2** (commit `43e8137`), MPL-2.0, Rust **edition 2024**. Edition 2024 needs
  Rust ≥ 1.85; jagua's code uses `{int}::cast_signed/cast_unsigned` (stable 1.87) and `i_overlay`
  7.x needs 1.88 → **our MSRV floor is 1.88** (toolchain pinned to 1.96). All deps pure-Rust (no C /
  no `build.rs`) → clean wheels.
- **Fork ≈ 5,800 LOC** (see `docs/01` §B): all of `geometry/` (ex-SVG) + `collision_detection/` +
  `entities/` + `io/import.rs`+`ext_repr.rs`+`export.rs` + `probs/bpp/` + `util/fpa.rs`. **Skip**
  `io/svg/`, `probs/spp`+`mspp`, and the `lbf` binary (read `lbf` only for the
  place/remove/save/restore call pattern — it owns the only RNG, which we replace).
- **Holes** live on the *container* as quality-0 zones (`Container.quality_zones`,
  `N_QUALITIES=10`). jagua 0.7.2 **drops item holes** → interior-void is modeled as container
  geometry / a second pass, never an item hole.
- MPL-2.0 is **uniform across this whole repo**: keep MPL headers on forked files, publish our
  modifications; new crates are MPL-2.0 too.

## Architecture / crate split (FINALIZED — Phase 1 landed it)

```text
crates/geo        forked jagua geometry primitives + transforms + fail-fast + shape_modification +
                  fpa, at f64. The geometry LEAF (no deps on entities/io/cde).
crates/cde        forked jagua CDE + quadtree + hazards + entities + io + probs/bpp + assertions, at
                  f64. Depends on geo; re-exports it as `geometry` (`pub use ironnest_geo as
                  geometry`) so upstream `crate::geometry::*` paths resolve unchanged.
crates/optimizer  OUR deterministic placement search (lifts sparrow's separator math, MIT — no link)
crates/ironnest   the public API:  nest(items, container, min_sep, rotations, seed, budget) -> [Placement]
crates/py         PyO3 binding -> the `ironnest` wheel (abi3-py313)
benches/  tests/   density + the cross-platform determinism golden
.github/           cibuildwheel (Win-x64 + macOS-arm64 + linux) -> PyPI; the x-platform golden gate
```

(The public `nest()` API can live in `optimizer` initially, then graduate to `crates/ironnest`.)

## Build / dev

- `cargo build --release --locked` · `cargo test` (commit `Cargo.lock` — auditability).
- Python dev loop: `cd crates/py && maturin develop --release` → `import ironnest`.
- Wheels: maturin + cibuildwheel, **abi3-py313**, targets `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`,
  `aarch64-apple-darwin`, `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`; publish via PyPI Trusted Publishing (OIDC).
- `cargo deny` (license allowlist) + a CycloneDX SBOM in CI.

## Claude Code workspace (how the rules above are made mechanical)

The repo is wired so the determinism rules are enforced, not just remembered:

- **`clippy.toml`** bans the hazards as lints — `HashMap`/`HashSet`, `Instant`/`SystemTime::now`,
  `mul_add`, and the std transcendentals (`sin_cos`/`sin`/`cos`/`tan`/`atan2`/`powf`/`exp`/`ln`).
  Enforced by `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`. Uncomment the `rand::*` entries once `rand` is a dep;
  add `#![warn(clippy::disallowed_types, clippy::disallowed_methods)]` to each forked crate root.
- **`rust-toolchain.toml`** pins rustc (1.96.0) + clippy/rustfmt/rust-analyzer/rust-src via **rustup**
  (not Homebrew rust — that can't pin and would drift on `brew upgrade`). Bump deliberately and
  re-bless goldens; never implicitly.
- **`.claude/settings.json`** — cargo command allowlist (fewer prompts), a `PostToolUse` `cargo fmt`,
  a `Stop` `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` gate (both no-op until a `Cargo.toml` exists), and enables
  the `rust-analyzer-lsp` plugin so diagnostics surface after every edit.
- **`.claude/agents/determinism-auditor.md`** — delegate a full hazard sweep before merging.
- **`.claude/agents/rust-reviewer.md`** — fork-aware quality / idiom / MPL review.
- **`/rust-determinism-audit`** skill — fast inline grep + clippy sweep.

One-time local setup: rustup (not brew rust) → `/plugin install rust-analyzer-lsp@claude-plugins-official`
(needs the `rust-analyzer` binary on PATH; the toolchain file installs it). For the cross-platform
golden use `cargo insta` snapshots of the **solver output** (`item,x,y,rotation`) — never hash the
wheel/binary (cross-platform binaries are never byte-identical; only the placement output is the
contract). Never build with `-C target-cpu=native`.

## Consumer & tracking

- Consumer: `drawing_and_gcode` (the plasma CAD/CAM app, Python), at
  `/Volumes/RAID-0/Code/Python/drawing_and_gcode`. It depends on the ironnest wheel and owns the
  safety re-validation. Integration is tracked there by **issue #258**.
- Density bar to beat: the consumer's `tools/nest_benchmark.py --mixed` (on branch
  `feat/blf-perf-and-interior-void`) — today's pure-Python engine tops **~75.5%** util; rectpack
  floor **67.3%**; target **~85–90%**.

## Working style

- Determinism-first; prove byte-stability in CI before claiming it. Match upstream jagua's code
  style in forked files. Don't commit/push unless asked. Keep the oracle boundary clean.
