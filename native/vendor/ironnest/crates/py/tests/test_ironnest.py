"""Smoke + determinism tests for the built `ironnest` wheel.

Run in CI after the wheel is installed (`pytest crates/py/tests`). The engine's *cross-platform*
byte-identity is proven by the Rust golden (Phase 3); these tests prove the wheel exposes that engine
correctly and that the Python marshalling preserves determinism (Python `float` is IEEE f64, so
`==` on the returned tuples is an exact bit comparison)."""
