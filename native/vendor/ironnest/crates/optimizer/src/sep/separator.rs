//! The separator: drive a layout (with overlaps) toward feasibility by repeatedly shoving colliding
//! parts to lower-overlap poses, guided by the GLS weights. Ported from sparrow
//! (`src/optimizer/{separator,worker}.rs`, MIT) as a **single deterministic worker** (no rayon, no
//! wall clock).
//!
//! `separate` is **Algorithm 9**, `move_items` is **Algorithm 5/10**. The budget is a fixed
//! `strike_limit × iter_no_imprv_limit` (never a clock); each move's effort is a fixed
//! [`SampleConfig`]. Between strikes the layout rolls back to the incumbent but the GLS **weights
//! are kept** — that accumulated pressure is what lets a wedged part jump elsewhere on the next try.
