//! The overlap *proxy* — a smooth, differentiable-everywhere stand-in for the true overlap area
//! between two shapes, computed from their inscribed surrogate poles (circles).
//!
//! Ported from sparrow (`src/quantify/overlap_proxy.rs` + `src/quantify/mod.rs`, MIT) to [`Scalar`]
//! = f64. It is **Algorithm 3/4** of the sparrow paper (arXiv 2509.13329).
//!
//! DETERMINISM(ironnest): the proxy is the search's *ranking* signal only — the CDE remains the
//! feasibility arbiter (see [`super::evaluator`]). Arithmetic is `+ − × ÷ sqrt powi` exclusively
//! (all IEEE-deterministic); no transcendentals. The pole *set* is byte-identical cross-platform
//! because it comes from the fork's ordered [`SPSurrogate`] generation. For a fixed nested-loop
//! order the pair sum is byte-identical on a given platform; pairs are always evaluated in the same
//! `(outer, inner)` order so the result is reproducible.
